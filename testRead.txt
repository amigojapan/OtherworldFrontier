プロローグ
物語は「千の物語の酒場」として知られる賑やかな酒場から始まる。この酒場は大陸の南端、ミストラルズ・エンドの街に位置し、冒険者、商人、そして旅人が宝と栄光の物語を共有するために集う場所だ。この町には冒険者用ギルドがない、だがこの酒場がそのような役割を果たしていた。^^そこでは代々伝説が語り継がれていた。

Prologue^The tale begins in the bustling tavern ^known as the 'Tavern of a Thousand ^Tales', nestled on the southernmost ^edge of the continent in the city of ^Mistral's End. Adventurers, traders, ^and wanderers gather here to share ^tales of treasure and glory.  ^The town doesn't have an adventurer's^guild, but this tavern serves a ^similar role... A whispered legend ^emerges once again:^^
^^'Beyond the Northern Tundra lies the ^Crown of Eternity, a mythical artifact ^created by God himself. It is said to ^grant unparalleled power or fulfill ^the deepest desire of whoever ^possesses it.'
^^Many have tried to claim the ^artifact, but the journey north is ^perilous. Ancient forests, deadly ^mountains, cursed wastelands, and ^frozen tundras and evil monsters ^stand between the brave and their ^goal. Most of them could not survive ^the journey.^^^Despite the odds, your party has ^decided to embark on this epic ^journey. Whether for riches, ^redemption, or renown, the stakes are^high, and the path ahead is fraught ^with danger.
amigojapan's backstory:^^amigojapan was born under a ^rare celestial event known as the ^Veil's Convergence, where the twin ^moons of Eternia aligned perfectly, ^casting the land in an eerie silver ^glow. This alignment was said to ^herald the arrival of those destined ^to shape the world's fate—be it for ^salvation or destruction....
